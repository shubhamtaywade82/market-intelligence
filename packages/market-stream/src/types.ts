/**
 * The continuously maintained market state for a single symbol+timeframe.
 *
 * This is the primary output of the live intelligence layer. It is updated
 * on every closed candle and is safe for downstream consumers (crypto-agent,
 * dashboards, CLIs) to read at any time.
 *
 * Design principles:
 *  - Immutable per snapshot. Each update produces a new object; the previous
 *    one remains valid for in-flight reads.
 *  - All numeric fields are full-precision strings (Decimal.toString()) so
 *    JSON serialization does not lose precision.
 *  - `activeEvents` contains only events whose `availableAtIndex` falls
 *    within the last `eventLookbackBars` candles of the buffer.
